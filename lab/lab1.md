Linux and macOS differ from Windows primarily due to being Unix-like systems, offering greater command-line integration, more open-source flexibility, and different approaches to hardware dependency. Key differentiators include Linux's open-source nature and high customization, macOS's integration with Apple hardware and polished user experience, and Windows' proprietary status, widespread user base, and user-friendliness for beginners.  
1. Open Source vs. Proprietary 
Linux: Free and open-source, allowing anyone to view, modify, and distribute its source code, fostering a highly customizable ecosystem with diverse distributions like Ubuntu and Fedora. 
macOS: A proprietary system owned by Apple, integrated with its specific hardware and offering a consistent, user-friendly experience. 
Windows: A proprietary operating system from Microsoft, known for its broad hardware compatibility and wide user base.
2. Command-Line Interface (CLI)
Linux & macOS: Both are Unix-compatible, meaning they feature robust command-line interfaces (like Bash) that are powerful for scripting, development, and system administration. 
Windows: While it has a CLI (like PowerShell), it is less central to daily use than in Unix-like systems and has a different syntax from macOS and Linux. 
3. Customization & Flexibility
Linux: Offers unparalleled customization, allowing users to choose different desktop environments, modify system components, and run on various hardware. 
macOS: Provides a sleek and intuitive experience with less customization than Linux, maintaining a consistent aesthetic across Apple devices. 
Windows: Offers themes and settings for personalization but is less flexible than Linux in terms of core system changes. 
4. Hardware & Software
Linux: Can be installed on a wide range of devices, making it a versatile and efficient choice for older or less powerful hardware. 
macOS: Designed for and optimized with Apple's hardware, resulting in high efficiency but restricting it to Apple devices. 
Windows: Available on a vast array of pre-built and custom computers from many manufacturers. 
Cost
Linux: Free for users, as it is an open-source project. 
macOS: Included with the purchase of an Apple device, but the hardware itself is often more expensive. 
Windows: A commercial product with licensing costs, though it is also the default on many low-cost devices.

The main differences are that graphical user interfaces (GUIs) use a mouse and visual elements for user-friendly interaction, while command-line interfaces (CLIs) require users to type text commands for more precise control and automation. GUIs are generally easier to learn and offer visual feedback but consume more system resources, whereas CLIs are resource-efficient, faster for complex tasks by experienced users, and offer powerful scripting capabilities for automation.

In Linux, the root directory is the topmost directory in the file system hierarchy and is represented by a single forward slash ( / ). It serves as the starting point for all other directories and files on the system.
Key characteristics of the root directory:
- Top-Level Hierarchy: All other directories and files in the Linux file system are organized as subdirectories or files within the root directory or its descendants.
- Single-Rooted System: Unlike operating systems like Windows that might have multiple drive letters (e.g., C:, D:), Linux utilizes a single, unified file system hierarchy with the root directory at its apex.
- Essential System Files: The root directory and its immediate subdirectories contain crucial system files, including the kernel, boot files, libraries, configuration settings, and user files.

- '>' overwrite file, '>>' Does the same as '>', except that if the target file exists, the new data are appended.

- Permissive licenses offer maximum freedom to use, modify, and distribute software with minimal restrictions, often only requiring attribution, you can even incorporating it into closed-source, proprietary products, while copyleft licenses require that any derivative works also be licensed under the same or compatible open-source terms
